# bfs-cuda
Implementation of parallel Breadth-first traversal algorithm in CUDA

## Usage:
```

To run algorithms on random generated graphs:
./main <start vertex> <number of vertices> <number of edges>

To run algorithm on graphs from standard input:
./main <start vertex> < input
Input should be in the form:
<number of vertices> <number of edges>
<end of edge1> <end of edge1>
<end of edge2> <end of edge2>
...

```

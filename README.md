# bfs-cuda
Implementation of simple parallel Breadth-first traversal algorithm in CUDA.

## Execution:
```
To build the project, run :
make

```
```

To run the algorithm on graphs from standard input:
./bfs <number of vertices> <number of edges> <source vertex>
<end of edge 1> <end of edge 1>
<end of edge 2> <end of edge 2>
<end of edge 3> <end of edge 3>
...

```
